  * Deployed to Maven central

### Version 1.2.2 - 2013-09-22 ###
  * Added `AttributesGenerator`, it is no longer necessary to write attributes by hand ([issue 22](https://code.google.com/p/cqengine/issues/detail?id=22))
  * See wiki page AttributesGenerator
  * Deployed to Maven central

### Version 1.2.1 - 2013-09-10 ###
  * Improved the toString representation of Query objects, query toStrings are now human readable ([issue 19](https://code.google.com/p/cqengine/issues/detail?id=19))

  * Added support to sort results in ascending/descending order on an attribute-by-attribute basis, with thanks to Roberto Socrates for patch ([issue 16](https://code.google.com/p/cqengine/issues/detail?id=16))
  * Example usage: `cars.retrieve(query, queryOptions(orderBy(ascending(Car.DOORS), descending(Car.PRICE))))`
  * This release involves a minor **API change** from CQEngine 1.1.x, so is not a drop-in replacement
  * Code using the old API to order results such as `cars.retrieve(query, queryOptions(orderByDescending(Car.PRICE, Car.DOORS)))` should be changed to that above
  * Deployed to Maven central

### Version 1.1.1 - 2013-08-18 ###

  * Deployed to Maven central

### Version 1.1.0 - 2013-08-16 ###
  * Updated `RadixTreeIndex`, `ReversedRadixTreeIndex`, `InvertedRadixTreeIndex`, `SuffixTreeIndex` to use [concurrent-trees library 2.1](http://code.google.com/p/concurrent-trees/wiki/ReleaseNotes) for lower memory usage and lower latency ([issue 14](https://code.google.com/p/cqengine/issues/detail?id=14))
  * Added `CQEngine.newObjectLockingInstance(int concurrencyLevel)` providing object-level locking on the write path for applications in which threads might race each other to add/remove the same object ([issue 9](https://code.google.com/p/cqengine/issues/detail?id=9))

  * Added `ReflectiveAttribute` - reflection-based attribute, for trading performance for convenience/flexibility/simplifying dynamic queries in some cases ([issue 6](https://code.google.com/p/cqengine/issues/detail?id=6))
  * Added benchmarks for indexing overhead ([issue 7](https://code.google.com/p/cqengine/issues/detail?id=7))

  * Added support for customizing via factories, the construction of maps and sets used internally by `HashIndex`, `NavigableIndex` and `CompoundIndex` (concurrency level, load factor etc.) ([issue 5](https://code.google.com/p/cqengine/issues/detail?id=5))
  * Deployed to Maven central

### Version 1.0.0 - 2012-10-29 ###
